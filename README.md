The purpose of the _remucs_ command line tool is to extract the individual stems from a mix and remix them again in a certain way.
Since the stem extraction is based on the [demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs) engine, the choice is restricted to the _drum_, _bass_, _vocal_ and _other_ sources.
