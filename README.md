The purpose of the _remucs_ command line tool is to extract the individual stems from a mix and remix them again in a certain way, e.g. by adjusting the volume gain, left-right channel balance and last but not least, applying transient-preserving pitch shifting. Since the stem extraction is based on the [adefossez/demucs](https://github.com/adefossez/demucs) engine, the stem choice is restricted to the _drums_, _bass_, _vocals_ and _other_ sources.
